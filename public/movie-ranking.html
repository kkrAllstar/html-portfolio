<h1>The Best Films According to Kris</h1>
<h2>My favourite movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Jurrasic Park</h3>
<p>Way ahead of its time and still fatastic viewing today, although the CGI hasn't aged well and looks really dated, such is the pace at which technology progresses.  That first moment where Dr's Alan Grant and Ellie Satler first lay eyes on the Brachisaurus, mouths gaping in sheer surprise as John Williams incredible score booms out still gets me to this day.  </p>
<p>The T-Rex escape, the tropical island setting, Richard Attenborough, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern kicking ass, the cool cars and jeeps, the athmospheric storm decending on the island, the list goes on and on and on for me.  Needless to say this film left a lasting impression on my youngers self, aged just 9 at its release.</p>
<h3>The Terminator</h3>
<p>An iconic film, a futuristic Sci-Fi plot and a badass Arnie</p>
<h3>Moneyball</h3>
<p>An underdog story of how against all odds, in an unfair sport, a small and unfancied team constantly outperformed and outwitted their competitors by revolutionising the study and application of data and statistics.</p>
